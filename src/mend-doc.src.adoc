=== Description
*{editor}*, a simple, flexible Unity extension. Made for users needing to encode vertex color data or create stunningly artistic polygons within Unity.
// end::desc[]


// tag::todo[]
=== Todo
Below are a few features currently missing which may be implemented if given a compelling reason.

* Vertex layer masks
* Support for brushing face midpoints
* Support for brushing bone weights
// end::todo[]


// tag::issues[]
=== Known Issues

* Does not prevent unintentional modifications to mesh bounds while painting is enabled.
* Undo may not take visual effect until the next brush stroke.
* Potential for optimization.
// end::issues[]


// tag::roadmap[]
=== Road Map

{name} is a foundation for whats to come.

* Currently developing a Suite of vertex color influenced procedural geometry modifiers inspired by Blender modifiers.
* Likely to come in toe with bundles and price drops.
* Enhancements and fixes.

=== Basic Usage

* Access *{name}* from menu: +
*Window > {editor}*
* Select a mesh from the inspector or by clicking a game object twice.
* With valid mesh selected click *Paint* button to edit.
* Set brush controls preferred mesh save mode as needed.

=== Application Overview

==== Usage Details

*{name}* can be accessed from the Unity menu by clicking _Window > {editor}_.   Once open {name} allows you to edit vertex colors of the selected Game Object shown in the _Game Object_ field.  The current selection must contain a Mesh for vertex color painting.  Activate the Paint button to start painting. *{name}* switches the shader to _{shader}_ to display vertex color edits while painting if _Show Vertex Colors_ is enabled.

include::mend-doc.src.adoc[tags=fig-usage]

While painting *{name}* prevents unintentional manipulation or object reselection.  Deactivate the Paint button to allow transform manipulation on the object and restore the mesh shader.

Vertex colors edits can be saved either directly to the Mesh or to a buffer which must be saved to file.   Use the _Mesh Target_ button to toggle between saving or buffering.  Use _Save Buffer_ to save a copy of the mesh to a chosen file.

==== Editor Controls

===== Game Object Selection
Display or set the current selected game object.
----
Type:       UnityEngine.GameObject
----

===== Mesh Target Selection
Displays the mesh to which edits will be saved.  Is set to the game object's mesh if it contains has a MeshFilter or SkinnedMeshRenderer.
----
Type:       UnityEngine.Mesh
----

===== Mesh Target State
Set the edit saving mode to saving or buffering.
----
Type:       Enum { Saving, Buffering }
Default:    Saving
----

===== Show Vertex Colors
Set the option to enable or show or hide the vertex color shader.
----
Type:       bool
Default:    true
----

===== Edit Back Faces
Set the option to enable or disable editing back-faces.
----
Type:       bool
Default:    true
----


===== Brush Size
Set the size of the brush.  The value represents the size measured as a percentage of the screen.
----
Type:       float
Default:    10.0
Range:      [1.0, 50.0]
----

===== Brush Strength
Set the blend strength of the brush.  The amount to lerp between the selected color and the current vertex color. A value of 1.0 maximizes the influence of the brushed color.
----
Type:       float
Default:    1.0f
Range:      [0.01f, 1.0f]
----

===== Stroke Frequency
Set the brush application frequency in milliseconds while the left mouse button is down.
----
Type:       int
Default:    10
Range:      [1, 4000]
----

===== Uniform Stroke
Vertices will only be affect once per stroke if enabled.
----
Type:       bool
Default:    true
----

===== Brush Functions
Set the function to use when applying color to vertices.
----
Type:       Enum { Value, Add, Subtract, Average, Random }
Default:    Value
----

===== Brush Color
Set the color apply to vertices.
----
Type:       UnityEngine.Color32
Default:    Color32 (255, 255, 255, 255)
----
===== Channel Lock Mode
Set the mode for channel locks between _red, blue, green, alpha_ and _hue, saturation, brightness/value, alpha_.

----
Type:       Enum { RGBA, HSBA }
Default:    RGBA
----
===== Channel Locks
Set the channels lock state while editing. Channels with a pressed button indicates that channel can be edited and has a channel lock value of _false_ .
----
Type:       bool[4]
Default:    [false, false, false, false]
----

==== Shader Settings

Mend will apply a shader on the mesh while in paint mode to display vertex colors. the wireframe color is exposed as an inspector property for _{shader}_ shader. Locate it in the Inspector under the Material component for the Mesh being painted.
